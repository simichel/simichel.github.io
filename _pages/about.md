Research topics
================
My research are mainly focused on numerical methods to solve **hyperbolic PDEs**. In particular,
I perform **stability analysis** (Fourier Analysis) of **high order methods**, as well as benchmarkings. 
So far, I studied particularly **explicite methods** in the **Eulerian formulation**, neverthless I am currently intering into **implicite/explicite** methods, 
in the **Lagrangian formulation** with adaptative remeshing technics. 

I also study, in a material deformation frame, **contact detection algorithms** to evaluate the most accuratly the dynamical response of materials.
